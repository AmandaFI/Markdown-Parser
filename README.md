# Parser and Interpreter that reads Markdown language and converts to HTML

## Application Overview

This project is constitued by a parser and a interpreter that work together to read Markdown language and transform to HTML language.

### Parser

The parser was implemented in TypeScript using the Parser Combinator technique that consists of combining simpler parsers to form more complex ones. In a simplified way, a parser is a function that receives a string as input and returns data structured in a specific format if the string matches certain condition, otherwise it returns an error. All parsers used were implemented from scratch (no external parser libraries were used) and a collection of tests was implemented to ensure their functioning. The tests were implemented using the Deno (built-in test runner) and are located in the parse_combinator.test.ts.

The Markdown parser accepts texts in markdown language as input and outputs an object similar to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) containing the parsed elements. In the section () the generated object structure will be detailed.


### Interpreter

The interpreter, also implemented in TypeScript, accepts the object generated by the parser as input and outputs HTML language. As explained in the section ..., each element present in the input object has a defined type and by using the (Discriminated Union) feauture of the TypeScript language, the interpreter can easily identify which action has to be performed in order to transform that element in a HTML element.


## Run ts 

- 


- Falar do arquivo de testes e dos tipos
- Print do formato da AST
- Explicar a sintaxe do markdown aceita pois tem algumas opções que nao foram implementadas
- Tem que intala Deno
- Como rodar o parser e os testes

HTML elements implemented so far:

- Heading
- Paragraph
- Bold
- Italic
- Unoredered List
- Ordered List
- Blockquote
- Link
- Image
